# ESG: Measurement-guided support of workforce well-being

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance and the importance of these corporate metrics was initially promoted by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan ([details](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))). "Social" includes workforce conditions. 

[Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work](https://www.glassdoor.com/Award) data allows identifying companies that are successful with their workforces.  The plot shows that Google and Microsoft are two examples. Below the plot are descriptions of Google's and Microsoft's measurement-guided interventions to optimize their workplaces.

### Google's measurement-guided interventions

#### Brightspotting to identify tactics of great managers: Google's Project Oxygen
> "interns set out to conduct double-blind qualitative interviews with managers from both the highest- and lowest-scoring categories. All interviewers were given a script to follow...they identified a set of eight behaviors that were common among high-scoring managers throughout the company...The first upward feedback survey with Oxygen attributes was sent out to employees in June 2010....By the end of 2010, a group within people operations started to build management training courses around the Oxygen findings...In 2011, the people operations group built and launched the ‘‘Start Right’’ class, a two-hour introductory course for new people managers that was built around the Oxygen attributes. In addition, people operations promoted its Manager Flagship series, which included ‘‘greatest hits’’ from each of the key topics."([Garvin, 2013](https://store.hbr.org/product/google-s-project-oxygen-do-managers-matter/313110?sku=313110-PDF-ENG). See also: [Bock, 2016](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=1-4447-9238-5); [Garvin, HBR, 2018](https://hbr.org/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-management); [Garvin, HBS, 2018](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=44657))

#### Hotspotting to identify and help less effective managers
> We’ve seen the least effective managers improve the most over time.’’ Setty noted that the HR business partners had been able to work closely with the lowest-scoring managers, helping them develop new skills or transition into non-management roles.([Garvin, 2013](https://store.hbr.org/product/google-s-project-oxygen-do-managers-matter/313110?sku=313110-PDF-ENG))

#### The role of senior leadership
>  ...you could set yourself out to remake the culture of your company and over a few years, with the support of the CEO, the board, or whatever, you could actually do this. ([Schmidt [Former CEO of Google] and Bock [Former Senior VP of People Operations at Google], 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbwq5it78_A}))

### Microsoft's measurement-guided interventions
> I said earlier that culture can be a vague, amorphous term. That’s why we worked so carefully to define the culture we wanted. And it’s why we measure everything. When it comes to humans, data is not perfect, but we can’t monitor what we can’t measure. So, we routinely survey employees to take their pulse. After three years of intensive focus on culture-building we began to see some encouraging results. Employees told us they felt the company was heading in the right direction. ([Nadella [CEO of Microsoft] et al, p117. 2017](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=9780062959720&offset=1))

#### Brightspotting to identify tactics of great managers
> Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of anecdotes about "what makes a great manager." And while many of those anecdotes are logical, it wasn't until recently that the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft has been able to use data to quantify some of these hypotheses ([Klinghoffer [Vice President, HR Business Insights at Microsoft], 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/managers-like-box-chocolates-dawn-klinghoffer/))

#### Hotspotting to identify and help units with low "thriving"
In this example, Microsoft used employee surveys to identify a hot-spot within their organization that needed help, but then Microsoft pursued non-survey data to find the solution.
> It came in the form of extensive surveys Microsoft used to monitor employees’ attitudes....Employees reported being much less satisfied with their work-life balance than their counterparts elsewhere at the company....the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data about how people work, and what makes a manager effective — would turn out to hold the solution ([Irwin. The New York Times, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/upshot/how-to-win-neil-irwin.html))...To test alternate theories, they identified which teams had particularly bad survey results on work-life balance and then looked for how their work patterns differed from those of teams with average or good survey results. They mined calendar and email data to reveal what differentiated teams where people were unhappy from those where things were fine ([Irwin. How to Win in a Winner-Take-All World, 2019](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=1250176271)).

#### The role of senior leadership
> The first—and most important step—is to engage the CEO and the senior leadership team. Microsoft’s appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO was a significant milestone for the company, and his role in culture change has been instrumental. Having a CEO and senior leaders who champion and embody culture change helps set the tone and provides a path for employees to follow ([Hogan [Chief People Officer at Microsoft], 2017](https://www.i4cp.com/interviews/kathleen-hogan-how-microsoft-is-transforming-its-culture)).

### ESG metrics
Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are:
* The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
